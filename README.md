# Fonix - Front End Challenge

### About :
```
A simple CSV parser made with JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents library "d3.js".
```

### The approach :

Since I have never attempted data visualisation before I had to do some research and try different technologies for the first time.<br>

I've tried both [P5.js](https://p5js.org) and [D3.js](http://d3js.org) and elected to use the later as it seems more capable and fun to work with (especially that I couldn't find examples of multi-line graphs in P5).<br>

The learning curve for D3 is pretty steep thus I couldn't finish the challenge within time. I intend to continue learning D3.js (and maybe revisit P5.js).



### Instructions :

clone the repo and open `index.html` in your favourite browser.
